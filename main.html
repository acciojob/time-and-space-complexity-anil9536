	What is Time and Space Complexity?
</h1>
	<p>
		Time Complexity: It is a measure of the amount of efficient time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of the input to the program. It is usually expressed using Big O notation, which describes the upper bound of the time complexity in the worst-case scenario.
</p>
	<p>
		<b>Space Complexity</b>: It is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm needs to run as a function of the size of the input to the program. It includes both the space needed by the input and the additional space required by the algorithm to execute O(n).
